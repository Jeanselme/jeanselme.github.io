title: "Sex differences in post cardiac arrest discharge locations"
collection: publications
excerpt: '*Background*  
We explored sex-based differences in discharge location after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.


*Methods*  
We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study including patients hospitalized after resuscitation from cardiac arrest from January 2010 to May 2020. We identified patients from a prospective registry, from which we extracted standard demographic and clinical variables. We explored favorable discharge location, defined as discharge to home or acute rehabilitation for survivors to hospital discharge. We tested the association of sex with the residuals of a multivariable logistic regression built using bidirectional selection to control for clinically relevant covariates.


*Results*  
We included 2,278 patients. Mean age was 59 (SD 16), 40% were women, and 77% were admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A total of 970 patients (43%) survived to discharge; of those, 607 (63% of survivors) had a favorable discharge location. Female sex showed a weak independent association with unfavorable discharge location (adjusted OR 0.94 (95%CI 0.89â€“0.99)).


*Conclusions*  
Our results suggest a possible sex-based disparity in discharge location after cardiac arrest.'
