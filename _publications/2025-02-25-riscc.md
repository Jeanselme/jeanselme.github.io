title: "riSCC: A personalized risk model for the development of poor outcomes in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This paper introduces a novel prognostic model for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and compare its performance to commonly used staging systems. To help medical practitioners quantify risk, we release an [app](https://www.scoutconsortium.org/app-landing-page) to compute riSCC.

*Background*  
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a prevalent disease for which improved risk stratification strategies are needed.

*Objective*
To develop a novel prognostic model (herein “riSCC”) for CSCC and compare riSCC performance to Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging 8th Edition (AJCC8) T staging systems.

*Methods*
Retrospective 12-center, multinational cohort study of CSCCs from 1991 to 2023. Clinical and pathologic risk factors, treatments, and outcomes were collected. Fine-Gray model was employed for each outcome with inverse probability of treatment weighting. A final model was trained for prospective use and estimation of hazard ratios.

*Results*
23,166 localized CSCC tumors were included. riSCC prognostic model performed superiorly to American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition and Brigham and Women’s Hospital T staging for all outcomes. At five years, the C-index for riSCC ranged from 0.74 for LR to 0.87 for DSD.

*Limitations*
Retrospective study design

*Conclusions*
riSCC prognostic model offers fine-grained risk estimates and improved stratification for important CSCC outcomes compared to T staging systems.'
