I am Vincent Jeanselme, a PhD student at the [MRC BSU](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My research interest lies in developing machine learning models to assist medical practitionners with a focus on reducing inequalities in medical care access and delivery.

My PhD, under the supervision of Dr Jessica Barrett and Dr Brian Tom, investigates how the interaction between patients and the healthcare system harm the application of machine learning models in real-world settings.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received an engineering degree in computer science and a masters degrees in machine learning from the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique et de Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/). Then, I worked as a research analyst at the [AutonLab](https://autonlab.org/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I developed machine learning models with a focus on medical applications such as hypotension prediction and haemorrhage detection.
