I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [reAIM](https://reaim-lab.github.io/) lab at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I work with Prof. Shalmali Joshi at the intersection of **machine learning**, **healthcare**, and **decision making**. My research focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models to support clinical decision-making, with a focus on reducing disparities in healthcare access and delivery. 

My [PhD thesis](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.112135), under the supervision of Prof. Jessica Barrett and Prof. Brian Tom at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), investigated how the interaction between patients and the healthcare system harms the use of machine learning models in real-world settings.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received an engineering degree in computer science and a master's degree in machine learning from the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique et de Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/). I also worked as a research analyst at the [AutonLab](https://autonlab.org/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I developed machine learning models with a focus on medical applications such as hypotension prediction and haemorrhage detection.
