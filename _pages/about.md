I am Vincent Jeanselme, a PhD student at the [MRC BSU](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), currently on a research visit at [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/). My research interest lies in developing machine learning models for temporal data with a particular focus on inequalities in medical care access and delivery.

My PhD investigates how the interaction between patients and the healthcare system harm the application of machine learning models in real-world settings, under the supervision of Dr Jessica Barrett and Dr Brian Tom.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received an engineering degree in computer science and a masters degrees in machine learning from the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique et de Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/). Then, I worked as a research analyst at the [AutonLab](https://autonlab.org/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I developed machine learning models with a focus on medical applications such as hypotension prediction and haemorrhage detection.
