I am Vincent Jeanselme, a postdoctoral researcher at the [MRC BSU](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), joining Columbia University in the fall. My research interest lies in developing machine learning models to assist medical practitioners with a focus on reducing inequalities in medical care access and delivery.

My PhD thesis, under the supervision of Dr Jessica Barrett and Dr Brian Tom, investigated how the interaction between patients and the healthcare system harms the application of machine learning models in real-world settings.

Before my doctoral studies, I received an engineering degree in computer science and a master's degree in machine learning from the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique et de Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/). Then, I worked as a research analyst at the [AutonLab](https://autonlab.org/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I developed machine learning models with a focus on medical applications such as hypotension prediction and haemorrhage detection.
