title: "From Cox to Neural Networks: Flexible Modeling Improves Modeling of Post-Kidney Transplant Survival"
collection: workings
excerpt: "Accurate prediction of graft failure is critical to enhance patient care following transplantation.
Traditional predictive models often focus on graft failure, overlooking other potential outcomes, known as competing risks, such as death with a functioning graft. 
This oversight theoretically biases risk estimates, yet the literature presents conflicting evidence on the gain associated with incorporating competing risks and leveraging flexible survival models.
Our work compares a traditional Cox proportional hazards model with the Fine-Gray model, which accounts for competing risks, utilising simulation studies and real-world kidney transplant data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
Additionally, we extend traditional methodologies with neural networks to assess the predictive gain associated with more flexible models while maintaining the same modeling assumptions. 
Our contributions include a detailed performance assessment between traditional and competing risks models, measuring predictive gains associated with neural networks, and developing a Python implementation for these models and associated evaluation metrics. 
Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for competing risks to improve risk estimation. These insights have substantial implications for improving patient prioritisation and transplantation management practices."
